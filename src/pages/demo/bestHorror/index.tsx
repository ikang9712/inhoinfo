            “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of
            the most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares,
            others may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that
            aren&apos;t necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of
            horror, and all have the same general effect: unease, dread, fear,
            shock, disgust.
